# Reinventing-the-wheel-aka-fizzbuzz

As you probably know by now, fizzbuzz is an asbsolute must if you're trying to get your 
first job as a develeper, therefore, I made myself without any help an there it is.

Program was written in Python 3.x, at first I created functions that takes number as an argument. The number 
itself defines range in which we want fizzbuzz to work. Body of function consists of for loop and three 
conditionals, first - if number is divisible by 3 AND 5, second - if number is divisible only by 3, and last 
one - if number is divisible only by 5. Simple as that.
